        <h2>History</h2>
        <h3>Pre Colonial Era</h3>
        <p>
            Before foreign influence, the islands of MIMAROPA were inhabited by diverse indigenous groups such as the
            Mangyan of Mindoro, Tagbanua and Palaw’an of Palawan, and early communities in Marinduque and Romblon. These
            groups practiced traditional agriculture, weaving, pottery, and maritime trade with Chinese, Malay, and
            other Southeast Asian traders. Their societies were organized into small settlements, each with unique
            customs, belief systems, and cultural traditions that remain preserved today.
        </p>
        <h3>Colonial Period (Spanish & American Era)</h3>
        <p>
            During the Spanish era, Mindoro became a mission and agricultural center; Marinduque served as a garrison
            and stopover; Romblon developed shipbuilding and marble industries; and Palawan played a strategic
            administrative and missionary role. Christianity, town-based governance, and new cultural influences spread,
            though many indigenous communities maintained autonomy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Under the American period, the provinces experienced growth in education, transportation, and government
            systems. New roads, schools, and public institutions were built, and migration from other parts of Luzon
            increased, especially in Palawan and Mindoro.
        </p>
        <h3>Modern History & Regional Formation</h3>
        <p>
            After World War II, the provinces developed economically through agriculture, fishing, quarrying, and rising
            tourism—especially in Palawan and Mindoro.
        </p>
        <p>
            On May 17, 2002, Executive Order No. 103 officially created MIMAROPA (Region IV-B) by separating the old
            Southern Tagalog region into CALABARZON (IV-A) and MIMAROPA (IV-B). A brief 2016 order to move Palawan to
            Western Visayas was later revoked, keeping all five provinces together. Today, MIMAROPA is known for its
            ecological diversity, indigenous heritage, and world-class tourism destinations such as Coron, El Nido, and
            Puerto Galera.
